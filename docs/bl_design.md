# Business Logic Layer (BL)

The Business Logic Layer (BL) is the core of our application, implementing the rules and operations that govern the behavior of the system. This layer is designed with a strong emphasis on software engineering best practices, ensuring that the application is robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## Key Features and Design Patterns

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each service class in the BL is dedicated to a specific domain area, such as administrators, applicants, or applications. This adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that each class handles a distinct set of operations, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
   - **Example**: The `AdministratorService` class is solely responsible for operations related to administrators, such as creating, updating, deleting, and authenticating administrators.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Before performing any operations, the BL classes use dedicated validation functions to check the integrity and consistency of the data. This pre-validation prevents invalid data from entering the system, ensuring data quality and reducing errors downstream.
   - **Example**: The `ApplicantService` class uses `validate_applicant_data` and `validate_household_member_data` to validate data before creating or updating applicants and household members.

3. **Error Handling with Custom Exceptions**:
   - The use of custom exceptions allows for precise error handling and feedback. These exceptions are specific to the business logic domain, making it easier to debug and manage errors effectively.
   - **Example**: In the `ApplicationService` class, custom exceptions like `ApplicationNotFoundException` and `InvalidApplicationDataException` provide clear, context-specific error messages that improve code readability and user feedback.

4. **Dependency Injection**:
   - The BL classes rely on dependency injection to receive instances of `CRUDOperations`. This practice enhances testability and allows for greater flexibility, as the dependencies can be easily swapped or mocked during testing.
   - **Example**: Each service class, such as `AdministratorService`, `ApplicantService`, and `ApplicationService`, takes a `CRUDOperations` object as a parameter in their constructors, allowing for decoupled and easily testable components.

5. **Security Measures**:
   - Security is a top priority, especially for operations involving sensitive data like passwords. The BL layer includes robust security practices, such as password hashing, verification, and account locking mechanisms to protect user data.
   - **Example**: The `AdministratorService` class hashes passwords with a salt before storing them and locks an administrator's account after a certain number of failed login attempts.

6. **Use of Type Annotations for Readability and Maintainability**:
   - Type annotations are used extensively across the BL layer to specify the expected input and output types for methods. This practice enhances code readability and helps with static type checking, reducing bugs and improving developer productivity.
   - **Example**: Method signatures in the `ApplicationService` class, such as `def create_application(self, applicant_id: int, scheme_id: int, created_by_admin_id: int, schemeEligibilityCheckerFactory: BaseSchemeEligibilityCheckerFactory) -> Application`, provide clear expectations about input and output types.

7. **Encapsulation of Business Logic**:
   - Each service class encapsulates the business logic for its respective domain, providing a clean interface for interacting with the data and ensuring that the logic is reusable and easy to modify.
   - **Example**: The `ApplicantService` class provides a method `create_applicant()` that handles the entire process of creating an applicant and their household members, ensuring that all necessary validations and checks are performed.

8. **Flexibility and Extensibility**:
   - The BL layer is designed to be flexible and easily extendable, allowing new features or changes to be added with minimal disruption. This design ensures that the application can evolve over time to meet changing requirements.
   - **Example**: The `ApplicationService` class can easily accommodate new application-related features, such as additional eligibility checks or new types of applications, thanks to its modular design.

9. **Factory Pattern for Eligibility Checks**:
   - The use of a factory pattern (`BaseSchemeEligibilityCheckerFactory`) allows the system to dynamically determine which eligibility checker to use, making the system flexible and extensible for different schemes.
   - **Example**: In the `ApplicationService` class, the `create_application()` method uses a factory to create a `SchemesManager` that checks an applicantâ€™s eligibility for a scheme, ensuring that the correct checker is used based on the scheme's requirements.

10. **Custom Data Serializers for Performance**:
    - The business layer leverages custom serialization utilities that can deeply serialize SQLAlchemy ORM objects into JSON-compatible dictionaries. This allows for optimized data transfer, especially for complex nested structures.
    - **Example**: The `serialize()` function from `utils/serializer.py` can handle nested ORM relationships while avoiding circular references and optimizing performance by using lazy loading.

## Potential Enhancements

- **Expanded Validation and Security**: Future updates will include more comprehensive data validation and enhanced security features to cover additional edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)**: Upcoming releases will integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring high-quality code and faster delivery cycles.

By structuring our business logic with these best practices, we ensure that the application is not only robust and secure but also easy to extend and maintain, fostering a reliable development environment for both current and future contributors.
