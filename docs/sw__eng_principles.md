The Advanced Business Logic layer is where the core intelligence of our Financial Schemes Management System resides. This layer is responsible for managing eligibility checks and benefit calculations for various financial schemes, providing a robust and flexible framework that can be easily extended to accommodate new rules and schemes.

# Key Components and Design Patterns
**1. Strategy Pattern for Eligibility and Benefit Calculation:**
The system uses the Strategy pattern to encapsulate the algorithms for eligibility checks and benefit calculations. This allows for easy swapping of algorithms depending on the scheme being processed, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
Example: The SingleWorkingMothersSupportEligibility and RetrenchmentAssistanceEligibility classes implement the BaseEligibility interface, each providing specific logic for their respective schemes.

**2. Abstract Base Classes and Inheritance:**
The BaseEligibility class serves as an abstract base class that defines the interface for all eligibility classes, enforcing a standard structure and behavior for eligibility checks across different schemes.
Example: Subclasses such as SingleWorkingMothersSupportEligibility inherit from BaseEligibility, implementing the required methods to define their specific eligibility criteria and benefit calculations.

**3. Factory Method and Abstract Factory Patterns:**
The Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns are employed to dynamically create instances of eligibility checkers based on the scheme. This design allows for easy extension to support new schemes and eligibility strategies.
Example: The SchemeEligibilityCheckerFactory uses a mapping of scheme names to corresponding eligibility checker classes to instantiate the appropriate checker dynamically.

**4. Facade Pattern for Simplified Interface:**
The SchemesManager class acts as a facade, providing a simplified interface for interacting with the complex eligibility checking logic. This design abstracts the complexity and allows clients to use a straightforward API to determine scheme eligibility for applicants.
Example: The method check_schemes_eligibility_for_applicant in SchemesManager coordinates the process of fetching schemes and checking eligibility, returning results in a consistent format.

**5. Named Tuples for Structured Results:**
The use of NamedTuple (like EligibilityResult) provides a clear and structured way to return eligibility results, enhancing readability and type safety.
Example: The EligibilityResult named tuple includes fields like scheme_id, scheme_name, is_eligible, and eligible_benefits, which clearly communicate the outcome of eligibility checks.

**6. Dependency Injection for Flexibility and Testability:**
Dependency Injection is extensively used throughout the business logic layer to pass dependencies like the database session and various factories. This design promotes loose coupling and makes the system easier to test and maintain.
Example: Both SchemesManager and SchemeEligibilityCheckerFactory are initialized with dependencies that can be easily mocked during testing.

**7. Error Handling and Default Strategies:**
The system gracefully handles cases where no specific eligibility strategy is configured for a scheme by defaulting to a DefaultEligibility class. This ensures consistent behavior and avoids runtime errors.
Example: If a scheme does not have a specific eligibility checker defined, SchemeEligibilityCheckerFactory falls back to using DefaultEligibility.

**8. Configuration Management for Flexibility:**
Eligibility criteria and benefits are configurable and stored in the database, allowing for easy updates and changes without modifying the core logic. This makes the system highly adaptable to changing requirements.
Example: The RetrenchmentAssistanceEligibility class uses configuration data from the Scheme model to determine eligibility criteria and benefits.

**9. Compliance with SOLID Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class has a single responsibility, whether it is managing eligibility checks, creating factories, or handling the orchestration of scheme management.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** The system is designed to be open for extension (new eligibility criteria and benefits can be added) but closed for modification (core logic remains unchanged).
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses like SingleWorkingMothersSupportEligibility can be substituted for BaseEligibility without affecting the system's behavior.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Interfaces are specific to their needs, ensuring that classes are not forced to implement methods they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The system depends on abstractions (interfaces and abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations, enhancing flexibility and reducing coupling.

**10. Clear and Maintainable Code:**
The codebase is organized with clear naming conventions and well-defined method signatures, making it easy for new developers to understand and contribute.
Example: Method names like check_eligibility and calculate_benefits clearly describe their purpose, and the use of type annotations provides additional clarity.

# Potential Enhancements
- **Dynamic Scheme Management:** Future updates will include an interface for administrators to define new schemes and eligibility criteria dynamically through a user interface, further reducing the need for code changes.
- **Advanced Reporting and Analytics:** Plans are underway to integrate reporting tools that will provide insights into scheme utilization and effectiveness, helping to inform policy decisions.
- **Enhanced Security Features:** To protect sensitive information, I plan to implement additional security measures such as encryption of data in transit and at rest, along with more granular access controls.

By implementing these advanced design patterns and principles, the Financial Schemes Management System provides a robust, flexible, and maintainable solution that can adapt to evolving requirements while ensuring consistency and reliability.
