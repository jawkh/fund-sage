Performs auto-approval for eligible applicants of the scheme, providing detailed information on the scheme, applicant, and awarded benefits. Performs auto-rejection for ineligible applicants and providing full details and the reasons for rejection. Ensures each applicant can successfully apply for each scheme only once. Allow applicants to reapply for a scheme multiple times if they were previously rejected. This caters to changes to the applicant's financial or health, etc conditions. The system will prevent an existing beneficiary from attempting to apply for the same scheme again.
